# Welcome 🖐 to the Weird Monster Project

This project is a simple weirdmonster created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with a fun and quirky monster character. The interface is styled using CSS to give the monster a unique appearance, while JavaScript handles dynamic interactions such as animations, customization, and other monster-related features.
